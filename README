This is my first javascript so comments and improvments are welcome!

I use Wells Fargo and a big problem when paying bills is that I cannot
get the amount that I am about to pay until after I paid. This is totally
ridiculous and Wells Fargo does not seem to care at all about adding
this feature. So I did! :D

script.js is meant to be used with Chrome/Tampermonkey but
a few modifications should allow it to run on Firefox/GreaseMonkey.
